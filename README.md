# CloudLandingZone
A `Cloud Landing Zone` is a pre-configured Cloud Environment within a cloud provider (like AWS, Azure, or GCP)  that that acts as a foundation for deploying applications and workloads.  It has guardrails, governance, automation and infrastructure so that teams can deploy workloads securely and consistently. Think of it like setting up a robust base camp before starting to build houses in a new territory. It's not just a single server; it's a whole set of pre-configured services, policies, and controls designed to ensure that anything you build there is secure, compliant, cost-effective, and manageable from day one. <br/>

Another analogy would be to think of it like setting up a new office building before anyone moves in. You wouldn't just throw up a sign and open the doors. You'd set up:
  * `Security (Access Control)`: Locks, security cameras, access cards. <br/>
  * `Utilities (Networking)`: Electricity, plumbing, internet. <br/>
  * `Departments (Resource Hierarchy)`: Designated areas for different teams. <br/>
  * `Rules & Regulations (Policies)`: Fire exits, safety procedures. <br/>
  * `Monitoring (Logging)`: Utility meters to track usage. <br/><br/>

A `Cloud Landing Zone provides` the digital equivalent of this foundational infrastructure, enabling efficient and secure cloud adoption.
